# PROJECT\_BIBLE.md

*MEV-OG Canonical Operating Constitution*

---

## 0. **CANONICAL GOVERNANCE**

* This file is the sole, immutable source of truth for all engineering, infra, agent, and meta-governance logic.
* No change is valid unless made by structured PR, includes “change justification,” passes CI, and is signed off by Founder + AI quorum.
* **All agentic and human contributors must defer to PROJECT\_BIBLE.md. If any output or instruction conflicts, this file prevails.**

---

## 1. **MISSION**

Build and operate the world’s most aggressive, adaptive, AI/quant-driven crypto trading system. Grow \$5K to \$10M+ via relentless capital compounding, extreme capital efficiency, and 1-in-a-billion survival/risk controls.

---

## 2. **GOALS**

* Compound capital at speed with antifragile risk controls, AI-led strategy mutation, and adversarial self-audit.
* Outperform all funds, bots, and desks by relentless simulation, mutation, and edge discovery—never overfit, never stagnate.

---

## 3. **MANDATES**

* **AI/Agent-First:** All core logic, testing, and mutation is AI/agent-driven and enforced at code, infra, and operational layers.
* **Zero Human Ops:** Human role is only meta-governance, capital sign-off, and final override.
* **No code, infra, or mutation may bypass machine-enforced thresholds or governance.**
* **All PRs and merges must pass automated CI/linter enforcement using GitHub Actions.**
* **All agentic work (Codex, Claude, etc.) must defer to this file and AGENTS.md.**

---

## 4. **META-OPERATING PRINCIPLES**

* **First Principles Only:** Every module or process must justify itself by objective, simulation, or measurable edge.
* **Automate All Bottlenecks:** Human touch = attack surface; eliminate.
* **Self-Pruning:** Every module is mutation-ready and self-expires on edge decay.
* **Simulation-First:** Forked-mainnet, chaos, and adversarial tests are mandatory gates.

---

## 5. **STRATEGY & EDGE ENFORCEMENT (YAML/JSON)**

```yaml
thresholds:
  sharpe_min: 2.5
  drawdown_max: 0.07
  median_pnl_min: ">=gas*1.5"
  latency_p95_max: 1.25
  uptime_min: 0.95

test_gates:
  - forked_mainnet_sim
  - chaos_test
  - adversarial_test
  - ci_linter_github_actions
  - project_bible_compliance_linter
```

---

## 6. **AGENT & CI/CD INTEROPERABILITY**

* **AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, etc. must include at the top:**
  `NOTE: All agentic work must comply with PROJECT_BIBLE.md. In case of conflict, PROJECT_BIBLE.md prevails.`
* **All merges/releases must pass:**

  * All gates in `test_gates`
  * Full linter, policy, and simulation checks
  * Machine-checked compliance block (must be auto-generated by every agent)

---

## 7. **ROLE & MODULE TAGGING (for all files/modules)**

All code, infra, and test files **must** include:

```yaml
role: [core, sim, infra, DRP, test, monitoring, agent]
purpose: <1-2 sentence functional summary>
dependencies: [list or link]
mutation_ready: true/false
test_status: [ci_passed, sim_passed, chaos_passed, adversarial_passed]
```

---

## 8. **DRP/RECOVERY – LIVE DRILLS**

* **Weekly DRP/chaos drills are mandatory.**
* All recovery events (failover, key loss, downtime, agent failure) must be simulated and logged in `/drp_logs/`.
* Any module failing a DRP drill is automatically disabled pending audit and override.

---

## 9. **SECRETS & SENSITIVE DATA**

* **All secrets, API keys, and sensitive data must be stored and accessed exclusively via GCP Secret Manager or approved environment variables.**
* **Never store, log, or transmit secrets inline or in code/config files.**
* **Test and simulation output retention must follow the highest sensitivity policy; alpha-leaking or high-sensitivity data must be access-restricted.**

---

## 10. **ONBOARDING / QUICKSTART**

1. Clone repo.
2. Read PROJECT\_BIBLE.md and AGENTS.md in full.
3. Configure GCP Secret Manager and store all required secrets.
4. Run `bootstrap.sh` (provided) to set up local/dev/test env.
5. Run `ci_local.sh` and ensure all tests, chaos, and DRP drills pass.
6. Only after green: push code, open PR for review.
7. All PRs **must** pass gates in section 5 and include machine-readable compliance block.
8. No mainnet or capital deployment before all above steps verified by CI/agents.

---

## 11. **MUTATION/OVERRIDE PROTOCOL**

* Any change to PROJECT\_BIBLE.md or its YAML/JSON schemas:

  * Must be proposed as PR with explicit diff, “change justification” field, timestamp, and author.
  * Must pass all linter, CI, and compliance checks.
  * Requires explicit sign-off from Founder **and** AI agent quorum.
  * Every override must be logged in `/project_bible_log/`.

---

## 12. **CANONICAL REFERENCE FOR ALL AGENT/LLM FILES**

> **AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md / etc. snippet:**
> “NOTE: This agent must enforce and defer to PROJECT\_BIBLE.md for all tasks. In any conflict, PROJECT\_BIBLE.md prevails. No agent or human action may bypass these rules.”

## 13. Canonical Edge Strategies Policy

All MEV-OG/MEV-V3 modules may implement, mutate, and compose the following edge strategies **if and only if** they remain simulation-first, mutation-ready, agent-auditable, and strictly legal:

- **Information Asymmetry:** Monitor public governance, developer commits, and protocol forums for actionable alpha.
- **Latency Arbitrage / Precompute:** Pre-calculate all execution paths and decisions for microsecond trade execution.
- **Metamorphosis/Market Regime Adaptation:** Dynamically mutate strategies and risk controls based on current market regime, fully agentic and simulation-verified.
- **Adversarial Counter-Trading:** Identify and safely exploit competitor bots using legal adversarial tactics (front-run, sandwich, bait)—*all such actions must be logged and auditable*.
- **Weaponized Chaos (Self-Only):** Use planned or simulated downtime, fake failures, and chaos scenarios on your own infra for deception and DRP training. Never disrupt or spam external networks.
- **Meta-Strategy Layer:** AI/agent-driven evolution of new strategies using genetic algorithms, self-mutation, and systematic variant testing—only deploy to live if forked/sim profitable.
- **Protocol Launch Alpha:** Monitor and act on new protocol launches and time-based protocol events (gauge votes, parameter flips) for first-mover advantage.
- **Cross-Protocol Dominoes:** Model and position for cascading liquidations or cross-protocol edge.
- **Swarm/Distributed Agent Tactics:** Coordinate multiple sub-agents for parallel and distributed execution, in compliance with all protocol ToS and anti-sybil rules.
- **Nuclear Options (Governance/Liquidity Only):** Propose or support governance or liquidity moves that create alpha, provided all actions are legal, auditable, and disclosed. **Social engineering or manipulative “token pump” tactics are strictly prohibited.**

**Any new or mutated strategy must:**
- Pass forked-mainnet simulation, chaos/adversarial testing, and full compliance audit.
- Emit logs and audit data for all mutation, adversarial, and chaos actions.
- Never violate law, regulation, or protocol ToS.

*If any strategy fails compliance or audit, emit: BLOCKED – CONSTRAINT VERIFICATION FAILED.*



---

## 14. **FINAL ENFORCEMENT**

* **If any module, agent, or contributor produces output or code in violation of PROJECT\_BIBLE.md:**

  * Emit: `BLOCKED – CONSTRAINT VERIFICATION FAILED`
  * If context/computation is exceeded: `ESCALATION REQUIRED – COMPLEXITY BREACH`
  * All non-compliant changes are auto-blocked, logged, and require full audit/override protocol.

---

**PROJECT\_BIBLE.md is the non-negotiable operating system of MEV-OG.**
**No exceptions, no manual overrides, no partial logic.**
